	* lt_analysis_gui.fig, lt_analysis_gui.m: Previous commit was wrong version, committing correct versions.
2006-05-29 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: Grouped 'spectrogram' and 'in box only' into a new subpanel for processing active file only.	
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Rewrote the computation and plotting of spectrogram so that it actually works now. 
	- Also added overlay of time-domain trace on to the spectrogram itself.

2006-05-18 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* fsanalysis_subgui.m, fsanalysis_subgui.fig:
	- fixed a bug in shifting the under-hood frequency window
	- Now shows harmonic markers for excitation frequency, while looking underh the hood
	- Added a menu that allows user to select the units of yaxis (e.g. Power, displacement, displacement*frequency etc).
	- Coding necessary for providing choices for the units of Y axis
	- Added option to view total harmonic distortion vs frequency
	- Fixed a bug in parsing the input array for under-the-hood frequencies
2006-05-18 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Fixed a bug where positionError field was ignored even when asked to be plotted.
	* fsanalysis_subgui.m, fsanalysis_subgui.fig:
	- Improved the speed of segment detection by ~300 times. Processing time is now within limits of patience.
	- Added ability to 'look under the hood' for what happens while processing a small user-selectable list of frequencies. Plots raw psd.
	- Now imports and puts legends on all the figures
	- Now only processes for the dimensions which are selected in the lt_analysis_gui
	- Added a "shifter" on GUI that conveniently shifts the 'look under the hood' frequency window.
	- Improved speed of computation of frequency sweep response
	- several other bug fixes.
2006-05-17 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* partial commit. Need to switch computer.
2006-05-15 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig:
	- Added ability to invoke other guis from within lt_analysis_gui. Using this for recently developed frequency_sweep analysis GUI.
	- Added a box on the GUI itself that displays useful information, e.g. guidelines for user, task being executed, status etc.
	- Added a checkbox to let user specify if the stage position needs to be filtered or not, at the time of loading the file itself.
	- Added ability to view spectrogram. (only one file at a time, no overlay). Useful to quickly diagnose frequency sweep data.
	- Removed frequency response checkbox. A whole new sub-gui serves its purpose now.
	- several other minor modifications here and there.

	* fsanalysis_subgui.m, fsanalysis_subgui.fig:
	- The subgui for frequency sweep analysis, that can be called from lt_analysis_gui.
	- Works for the data analyzed so far.	 	

2006-05-10 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: One step closer to analyzing frequency sweep data. Also couple of improvements in how removal and reloading of datasets is handled.

2006-05-03 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
		- Added ability to attach frequency-sweep excitation data with tracker log. 
		- Made some progress towards processing frequency sweep data, left incomplete.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: Some cosmetic improvements and disambiguation.
2006-04-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Turned off 'pretty_plot' command for main figure. According to profiler it was taking a long time to execute. Should came back to it and find out why.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Turned off filtering of stage. Untill this option is made accessible through GUI, filtering would have to be done manually. Automatic filtering seems to be a bad idea when tracking is lost and the originial file contains uneven time-stamps for a small span.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Sets and supplies correct flags to load new or edited files. Comaptible with load_laser_tracking 02.01
2006-04-14 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Offset in the .drift. field is now set to zero, so that dependent codes don't have to add it back manually while subtracting drift using 'polyval'. Related changes allover.

2006-04-13 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Fixed a bug so where 'magdata' field was left empty when there was no magnet data attached to it. Now defaults to zero.
	- Does not automatically refresh the main figure window when switching to different files. Refreshing takes a while and gets annoying if not intended.

2006-04-11 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Loads and saves files correctly
	- Removes stage noise by default
	- Fixed couple of bugs and typos in frequency processing.
2006-03-27 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Added ability to save modified files as well as load thus saved files.
2006-03-05 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Now doesn't refresh time-domain plots automatically when any setting is changed. Added a separate button for that.
	- Incorporated msdbase code (soon to be committed) into gui.
2006-01-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdsai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Now asks user for confirmation when a file in the 'to load list' is already loaded in the data base. Eliminates need of first removing the file and reloading it when changing the experiment type.
	- Fixed a bug in plotting of multiples PSDs of lowbandwidth dat2
	- Fixed a crash that happened when user 'cancelled' edits of tag.
	- Now 'Cut' allows to select a point outside axis as the boundary. Useful when we want to remove all the data before or after certain time.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: 'Overlay Ch 8' renamed to 'Overlay Mags'

2006-01-27 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Now loglog plots are plotted taking log of the signal first and then plotting on linear axis.
	
2006-01-12 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed several bugs with PSD computation and plotting
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: All fonts are now 8 points, this makes it look right on Tim's laptop. 

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed the bug where program crashed while trying to 3d-plot empty data.
	- Fixed the behaviour of dragging box after zoom
	- Now prints the results on command line in addition of displaying it.

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added ability to play sound for the data selected inside box
	- Also plots a spectrogram of the signal while playing the sound.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig
	- Added button for playing sound
	- Added a frame, using to mask the controls when program is busy and needs to avoid accidental clicks.
	
2005-12-26 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Added a check for empty database in couple of places.

2005-12-26 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Replaced the referenced fieldnames of the global database with absolute names, thus improving readability of the code and  speed of the program. Referencing was useful only while the absolute names were in experimental phase.
	- Fixed a typo.

2005-12-23 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added back the ability to compute psd, compute 'accumulative displacement' and overlay the results for multiple files on a common plot. Enabled 'plot' button.
	- Added checkbox to do frequency-domain analysis of the data selected in time-domain by drawing a box.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: Same +
	- Moved 'Add FS data' button into master database management panel.

2005-12-22 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Miscellaneous bug/typo fixes.

2005-12-22 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Upgraded the whole program to exploit the new 'matrix output' feature of load_laser_tracking.
	- corrected the positioning of overlayed magnets, so that they are reliably visible
	- added 7th field in the global master database: 'drift' and removed the field: 'experType'
	- Added  ability to select 'drift section' and then remove that drift from rest of the data
	- Improved interface for drawing and dragging box, now using radios and buttonDownFcns
	- Changed the 'cut' behavior to 'remove inside box' instead of 'remove outside box'
