	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed several bugs with PSD computation and plotting
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: All fonts are now 8 points, this makes it look right on Tim's laptop. 

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed the bug where program crashed while trying to 3d-plot empty data.
	- Fixed the behaviour of dragging box after zoom
	- Now prints the results on command line in addition of displaying it.

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added ability to play sound for the data selected inside box
	- Also plots a spectrogram of the signal while playing the sound.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig
	- Added button for playing sound
	- Added a frame, using to mask the controls when program is busy and needs to avoid accidental clicks.

	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Added a check for empty database in couple of places.

2005-12-26 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Replaced the referenced fieldnames of the global database with absolute names, thus improving readability of the code and  speed of the program. Referencing was useful only while the absolute names were in experimental phase.
	- Fixed a typo.

2005-12-23 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added back the ability to compute psd, compute 'accumulative displacement' and overlay the results for multiple files on a common plot. Enabled 'plot' button.
	- Added checkbox to do frequency-domain analysis of the data selected in time-domain by drawing a box.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: Same +
	- Moved 'Add FS data' button into master database management panel.

2005-12-22 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Miscellaneous bug/typo fixes.

2005-12-22 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Upgraded the whole program to exploit the new 'matrix output' feature of load_laser_tracking.
	- corrected the positioning of overlayed magnets, so that they are reliably visible
	- added 7th field in the global master database: 'drift' and removed the field: 'experType'
	- Added  ability to select 'drift section' and then remove that drift from rest of the data
	- Improved interface for drawing and dragging box, now using radios and buttonDownFcns
	- Changed the 'cut' behavior to 'remove inside box' instead of 'remove outside box'
	- Now in the 3D plot the data inside box has different color than data outside box.
	- Several miscellaneous fixes of typos and bugs.
	* lt_anlaysis_gui.fig: same

2005-12-20 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added  3d plotting ability
	- Added ability to overlay channel 8 (wire from magnet DAC) onto position traces.
	- Added calculation and display of raw peak to peak measurement inside box.
	- Improved default positioning of 'results' window
	- Fixed a typo in the calcualtion of radial displacement.
	* lt_anlaysis_gui.fig: same
2005-12-19 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: The new and more appropriate name for the old file FreqSweepAnalysis.m. 
	- Competely renovated, now targetted for interactive analysis of a much broader range of experiments. 
	- Frequency Sweep analysis is still disabled.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: same.
2005-11-30 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.m, freqSweepAnalysis.fig: Several new features e.g. plotting 3d trace, XYZ time series etc.
2005-11-15 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.m: Several new features e.g. calculating and ploting cumulative displacement upto certain frequency, plotting for stage etc. 
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.fig: Couple of relevant checkboxes

2005-10-18 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.m: Now in finely working condition for passive data.
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.fig: Couple of other buttons and fixes.
	
2005-10-17 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* ChangeLog.txt: First entry.
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.fig: A GUI for analyzing frequency sweep data. Only passive data for now.
	* FreqSweepAnalysis.m: A matlab file that goes with it.
