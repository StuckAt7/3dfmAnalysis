2007-11-15  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	evt_gui.m: 
		- overhauled the auxilary plot interface.  
		- can now plot individual MSD curves and/or the mean MSD.  
    - can now plot viscoelastic profiles (G and eta, complex) as functions of frequency via the Generalized Stokes-Einstein Relation (GSER).
    - added the pole_locating function for driven bead experiments.
    - fixed bug that delayed updates to plots.  plots update as expected now.

2007-10-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* evt_gui.fig: same. 
	
2007-04-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: added axis labels to XY figure.

2007-04-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: lots of changes.
			- figures opened by evt_gui now close automatically upon exit.
			- renamed RTfigure to AUXillary figure to contain non-imperative data, such as radial displacement or trackers vs frame#.
			- disabled controls until data has loaded (avoids annoying but understandable matlab errors).
			- trimming data now works in pixel and micron length scales.
			- selecting closest dataset now works in pixel and micron length scales.
			- exporting a single bead to the base workspace now works.
			- removed magnet log overlay.  no one uses it.  if it becomes necesary, it can be reinstated.
			- radial plotting code now makes more sense.
			- added commenting to old code as new code was written.
	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2006-10-26  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2006-03-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: removed code for "Close All Figures" button.  Now, the existence of an XY, XT, or RT figure is checked and used if exists, otherwise it generates a new figure.  Reduces the number of open figures.
	* evt_gui.fig: removed "Close All Figures" button.

2006-02-03  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: now includes an edit box for setting custom frame rates.
	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2006-01-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: exporting trackers to base workspace now includes YAW values.

2005-12-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: enabled the 'center-of-mass' drift subtraction ability in the GUI.

2005-11-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: minor adjustment to time offset for beads exported to workspace.

2005-11-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.fig: cosmetic changes.  added "Close Figures" button.
	* evt_gui.m: same.  fixed bug where exporting all beads to workspace only exported the first bead N times.

2005-11-04  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m:  added export all beads button. added numerical suffix to variable name for individually exported beads.
	* evt_gui.fig: same.
	
2005-10-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* evt_gui.m:  fixed bug in plotting the radial vector.

2005-10-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m:  added drift subration methods: 'linear' for removing the linear drift associated with each bead individually and 'center-of-mass' for removing drift along the center of mass vector. added controls for superimposing magnet log data on top of displacments (not yet fully implemented).  Added controls for displaying displacement data in 'microns' instead of 'pixels.'
	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2005-09-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: suppressed debug output mistakenly left in code.

2005-09-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.fig: hopefully fixed the "GUI doesn't work on lower video resolution" problem.

	* evt_gui.fig: same.

2005-08-11  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: removed a duplicate function name to get rid of annoying warning messages.

2005-08-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: added code that plots time using the first time point as zero.  This was done to offset the change made in glui_take, where the recorded timestamps are now in UCT.

2005-07-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: improved filename/filetype handling.  improved but did not completely fix the plotting update problem (where a deleted point is not removed from a plot until focus is removed from that tracker).

2005-06-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: improved the way intensity projection images are included in editing video tracking files.
	
2005-05-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_gui.m: updated load_video_tracking call.

2005-02-02  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* evt_GUI.m:  fixed a file formatting problem.

2005-01-29  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evt_GUI.m:  contains matlab code for editing video tracking data (evt).  Works with Video Spot Tracker v4.0.  Initial Version.
	* evt_GUI.fig:  defines the matlab GUI for editing video tracking datasets.  Initial Version.
