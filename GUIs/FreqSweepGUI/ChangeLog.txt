	* mysignal.m: 
	- removed the interfering junk code of the non-existent slider for 'period' setting.
	- Errorless quitting and closing.
	* threePoleFreq.Sweep.m:
	- The applied frequencies are now half than the values in the requested frequency vector. This is necessary because for three pole case, the force frequency is always double the excitation frequency.
	- Fix a bug in control-frequency generation.

	* threePoleFreqSweep.m, threePoleFreqSweep.fig:
	- A GUI tool for sinusoidal force applications using three-pole geometry
	- First version: 1.0

	* mysignal.m:
	- Adjusted the excitation values such that there is no 'step' occuring at start or end of any frequency.
	- Renamed all varibles named as *1, *2 eg. coil1,coil2, amp1, amp2 etc to *A and *B to avoid confusion
	- Added a gap containing zero values between sinusoids for each successive test frequency.
	- Fixed default values of the pk2pk range. Now pk2pk = 2*offset by default

	* mysignal.fig:
	- Added a note on the GUI describing the conditions for excitations that will cause sinusoidal motion of the bead.
	- Minor coloring and typo-fixings.

	* mysignal.m, mysignal.fig:
	- First commit
	- useful for pulling a bead with highfrequency sinusoids
	- at this point only two coils can be used at a time.
	- allows arbitrary choice of amplitude, offset, phase for each channel
	- arbitrary frequency vector can be provided
