	* pan_read_well_layout.m:  added.  Reads in the "well layout" csv file generated by Russ's Well Layout program designed for Panoptes.   The data are outputted to a data structure whose design depends on the fields saved by the well layout application.
	* pan_combine_data.m:  added.  uses the well_layout structure to combine data using the inputted field as the means to "slice" through the data.  Only works for a single parameter at this time.
	* pan_process_CellExpt.m:  added.  Analyses, reports, and publishes results for the "Cell Experiment" specified for Panoptes..
	* pan_analyze_CellExpt.m:  added.  contains analysis protocol for Cell Experiment.
	* pan_publish_CellExpt.m:  added.  Publishes results for "Cell Experiment".
	* pan_load_metadata.m:  modified to use pan_read_well_layout.m

	* pan_wellpass.m:  re-ordered outputs to follow the function names convention of "well" then "pass".

	* pan_cell2well.m:  added.  converts the spreadsheet "cell" coordinate to a well ID.
	* pan_wellpass.m:  added.  extracts the pass and well IDs from a filename.
	* pan_sim_newt_run.m:  added.  simulates the output of a simple Newtonian rheology Panoptes experiment. It generates paths for beads in a Newtonian fluid for a given number of passes and well IDs and saves them to disk.
	* pan_read_MCUparamsfile.m:  added.  extracts the "pixels to microns" conversion factors for each pass and well for panoptes runs.
	* pan_read_wells_txtfile.m:  added.  parses the "wells.txt" file for a panoptes run.
	* pan_load_metadata.m:  added.  reads in the several metadata files generated by a panoptes run and outputs a single metadata structure.

	* .csvignore:  added.  tells cvs to ignore .asv files.

2011-07-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  now fails nicely when no data are found.  Also added more standardized logging output.

2011-07-12  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  fixed bug where new window size definition screws up the plotting parameters.

2011-07-06  Anya Derbakova <anya@cs.unc.edu>
        * pan_CellProcessingScript:  added. Runs CellProcessingScript.m and exits Matlab.

2011-07-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  added Anya's edit for correctly parsing new "_tracked" filenames.

2011-07-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  Now uses the newer method for determining which window sizes to use when calculating the MSD on input data.

2011-04-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  Adds both plots to the output and saves the figures as Matlab .fig files as well as .png files.

2011-04-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* CellProcessingScript.m:  added.  Processes Cell Diffusion experiments for Panoptes.

2011-04-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* pan_mucus_rheo_run.m: added.  moved from 3dfmAnalysis/specific/rheology.  This is panoptes rheology analysis code in its early stages.  specific for mucus samples.
