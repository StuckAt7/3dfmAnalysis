	* simforces.  added this folder to contain force simulation code.

	* visVelocities.m : Replaced the code for placing a colorbar with the new found matlab function 'colorbar'. Also changed the rendering in 'hairs' mode back to with white background sphere.

	* visVelocities.m : Changed the visualization for 'colors' mode. Instead of using faces as bins, now using vertices as bins. This is more efficient and also facilitates interpolation. Also included code that automaically plots color scale bar on right.

	* visVelocities.m : Changed the visualization for 'colors' mode. Making bins by tessellating the sphere by equilateral triangles, instead by forming latitues and longitudes. This tessellation makes area of all bins approximately equal, so provides uniformal sampling over surface of sphere. Tessellation is done by a tool - 'sphere_tri.m' - downloaded from internet from GNU-opensource. Requires the 'sphere_tri.m' file and all the files being called by this function (eg. 'sphere_project.m', 'mesh_refine_tri4.m' etc) in the matlab path.

	* visVelocities.m : modified to work for hexapole geometry also.
