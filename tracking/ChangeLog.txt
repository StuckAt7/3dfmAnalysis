	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Added default storing of uct_offset (universal coordinated time of first sample) within info.orig
	- Changed default bead size value to 'NOT AVAILABLE', instead of 0.957
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m: commented out the time-offset removal from 'laser' field 
	* tclip.m : Replaced 'varargin' with 'nargin' as it should be.

	* load_vrpn_tracking: 
	- Added feature to select displacement units (meters|microns) of position error, stage reports and bead positions. Previously, this was only possible for stage commands
	- Fixed the bug of getting weird first entry in position error log, messing up the whole data set when offset is being subtracted out. This was happening because we don't have jacobian available for first position error, so using default jacobian. Fixed it by discarting the first sample.

2004-06-11	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m: Added an arguement to select if we want to remove the offset from computed bead positions. Also re-commented the whole header to make consitent with updates.
	* tclip.m: just renamed the flag 'save' to 'fsave' to avoid using reserved keywords.

2004-05-20	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m: Subtract off the time-offset before plotting graphs.

2004-05-19	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: added feature to let user specify if the resultant file needs to be automatically saved.

	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Do not try saving the file name when data is supplied in form of a matlab variable.
	- changed XYZunits options to 'u' and 'm', this used to be 'um' and 'm', creating ambiguity.
	
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- replaced '.stage.' with '.stageCom.', to accord with changes in load_vrpn_tracking.m

	* load_vrpn_tracking.m : Fixed the comment about default 'time' argument - should have been 'uct'
