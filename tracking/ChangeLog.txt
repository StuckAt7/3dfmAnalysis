	* remove_drift.m: added drift velocity estimates for y to output log.

2006-01-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: output log now reports y's slope and intercept as well as x's.

2005-12-22  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* load_laser_tracking.m: Fixed a missing semicolon, which caused flood on the prompt when 'position error' field was sought for.

2005-12-21  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* load_laser_tracking.m: version 1.01
	- Added option to request output fields in the form of a [time, vals] matrix rather than the traditional structure.
	- By default, the output form is the traditional structure so existing dependent code shouldn't break.
	- Wrote a routine that centralizes the parsing algorithm for different fields. Used for most of the fields.
	- Fixed several comments.

2005-12-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: finished implementing the center of mass drift subtraction method.

2005-11-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: Fixed "not enough points" warning that occurred when a tracker did not exist during the drift-estimation time period.

2005-11-17  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: added 'table' parameter to the documentation
	* remove_drift: now reports the drift velocity removed from each coordinate for each bead.

2005-10-12  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* load_laser_tracking.m: Added. Version 1.0
	- clone of load_vrpn_tracking, but cleaner, more efficient and easy to use. Didn't want to break the dependent code, so created anew with more appropriate name.
	- Compatible to log files created by laser tracker 04.00 and later only.
	- Loads only those fields which are requested, thus conservs memory.
	- Function input signature is changed, but output format is same as load_vrpn_tracking.

2005-10-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: removed stupid typo.

2005-10-10  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
  * remove_drift.m: added.  removes drift from video datasets using either center-of-mass or linear approximation methods.

2005-09-22  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: fixed filter on older spot_tracker .vrpn.mat files.  Fixed logentry that liked to repeat itself.

2005-09-16  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:  new cvs updates of load_vrpn_tracking has inserted lines between code.  Removed these extra lines, because the actually break the code.

2005-09-13  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m:  fixed stupid logentry typo.

2005-09-13  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m:  fixed a bug where perfectly good timestamp files were not loaded due to getting the filename wrong.  Added logentries so that a message is printed to stdout when timestamps are/are not loaded.

2005-08-31  Kalpit Desai  <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:

2005-07-19  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	*	load_video_tracking: timestamps are now in unixutc format (number of secondssince 00:00:00 1970/01/01) and now two-column timestamps are handled.

2005-06-29  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: makes older version imported vrpn files look like newer version imported vrpn files.

2005-06-29  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: now uses video_tracking_constants for column labeling.  Fixed a 'off-by-one' bug where some beads were not counted.
	* batch_load_video_tracking.m: now uses video_tracking_constants for column labeling.

2005-06-27  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-06-22  Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m: Fixed the calculation of BeadPosition.

2005-06-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-05-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: added table parameter that allows one to switch between structure and matrix/table output.
	* get_bead.m: now handles either output type.

2005-05-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* filter_out_repeats_in_vrpn.m: added.

2005-05-17  Sorrell Massenburg <massenburgs@unc.edu>

2005-05-09	Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: MAJOR CHANGES to output format.  Prior to this version, load_video_tracking outputted a matrix that required all beads to exist for all times; zeros were used as placeholders.  This was changed to reflect Video Spot Tracker's output more truthfully.  Also added support for '.evt.mat' data format.
	* get_bead.m: added.  Extracts a specific bead's data from new load_video_tracking.

2005-04-06	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m: 
	- Now compatible with laser tracker 02.13
	- Tells user when swaping vrpn time stamps with separately logged 'even' time stamps.
	* tclip.m: fixed function signature in the documentation.

2004-10-23	Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: added filter on input file (in case it's not a struct).

2004-08-22	Jeremy Cribb	<jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: Repaired documentation (did not explain relative/absolute position choice in parameter list)

2004-06-26	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: Made 'all fields' as default for fields to be clipped.

2004-06-22	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: Fixed a typo.

2004-06-22	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: Added feature to select only those files which are wanted in the clipped dataset. All other fields will be removed. Saves hard-drive space.

2004-06-18	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: Reduced the tolerance level for finding correct clipping points for low bandwidth data to 0.0005 seconds from 0.05 seconds. Provides more precise clipping.

2004-06-17	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tjoin.m: Fixed a bug that was throwing out the meta-data information when two datasets being joined are themselves result of two/more datasets previously joined.

2004-06-17	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Added default storing of uct_offset (universal coordinated time of first sample) within info.orig
	- Changed default bead size value to 'NOT AVAILABLE', instead of 0.957
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m: commented out the time-offset removal from 'laser' field 
	* tclip.m : Replaced 'varargin' with 'nargin' as it should be.

2004-06-14	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking: 
	- Added feature to select displacement units (meters|microns) of position error, stage reports and bead positions. Previously, this was only possible for stage commands
	- Fixed the bug of getting weird first entry in position error log, messing up the whole data set when offset is being subtracted out. This was happening because we don't have jacobian available for first position error, so using default jacobian. Fixed it by discarting the first sample.

2004-06-11	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m: Added an arguement to select if we want to remove the offset from computed bead positions. Also re-commented the whole header to make consitent with updates.
	* tclip.m: just renamed the flag 'save' to 'fsave' to avoid using reserved keywords.

2004-05-20	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m: Subtract off the time-offset before plotting graphs.

2004-05-19	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: added feature to let user specify if the resultant file needs to be automatically saved.

2004-05-19	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Do not try saving the file name when data is supplied in form of a matlab variable.
	- changed XYZunits options to 'u' and 'm', this used to be 'um' and 'm', creating ambiguity.
	
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- replaced '.stage.' with '.stageCom.', to accord with changes in load_vrpn_tracking.m				

2004-05-18  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m : Fixed the comment about default 'time' argument - should have been 'uct'

2004-05-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Initial Version
