	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Do not try saving the file name when data is supplied in form of a matlab variable.
	- changed XYZunits options to 'u' and 'm', this used to be 'um' and 'm', creating ambiguity.
	
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- replaced '.stage.' with '.stageCom.', to accord with changes in load_vrpn_tracking.m
