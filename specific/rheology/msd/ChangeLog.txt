The standard error reported by the code is weighted by the number of existing datapoints for each window size rather than the global number of trackers for the entire input dataset.
	* ve.m: same.

2005-10-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* msd.m: added.  Reimplemented algorithm for computing mean-square displacement as found in Mason's 2000 Rheol Acta paper.  Mostly done for better understanding of the algorithm, but placed here as it works cleanly with the new version of load_video_tracking.
