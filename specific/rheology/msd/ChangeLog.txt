	* ve.m: rearranged output data structure such that each bead's data is stored in 'raw', the mean values in 'mean', and the standard error values in 'error'.

2005-08-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* ve.m: fixed a warning regarding the use of the variable 'gamma' which is also a function in matlab.

	* msd.m: corrected documentation to read default filemask is '*.evt.mat'.

2005-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: vectorized innermost for-loop so that msd runs more quickly.

2005-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: added.  Reimplemented algorithm for computing mean-square displacement as found in Mason's 2000 Rheol Acta paper.  Mostly done for better understanding of the algorithm, but placed here as it works cleanly with the new version of load_video_tracking.
	* ve.m: added.  Uses output of msd.m to compute, output, and plot the viscoelastic moduli (as determined by mean-square displacement computation).

	* batch_msd_2d.m: changed to function from script.
	* msd_2d.m: changed to function from script.

	* Change batch_load_video_tracking to be able to handle the 40x and 60x lenses

	* Changed msd2pt to be a funtion

2005-06-10  David Hill <dbhill@email.unc.edu>

	* Added batch_msd2pt to more quickly get thru 2pt rheology calculations

2004-08-31  David Hill <dbhill@email.unc.edu>

	* Initial Version of Mean Squared Displacement Code
