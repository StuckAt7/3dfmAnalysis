	* .cvsignore: added.  
	* dmbr_mean_creep_curves.m: removed.  obsolete.
	* dmbr_compute_mean_curves.m: added.  computes all significant mean values for dmbr datasets.
	* dmbr_plot_data.m: updated to include mean figures and plotting "stacked" sequences.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.fig: same.
	* dmbr_analysis_gui.m: same.
	* dmbr_report.m: cosmetic changes only.  will soon update this substantially.
	* dmbr_run.m: computes offsets for each sequence/voltage.
