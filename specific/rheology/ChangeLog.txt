	* visc_ps.m: corrected the 'water' and 'karo' reference lines on the output plot.

2005-11-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* percent_recovery.m: added output variables that report the maximum distance traveled, the distance recovered, as well as the percent recovery.
	
2005-11-17  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time.m: used a better approximation for the minimum value (so that the "minimum" is centered around zero).

2005-08-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time.m: commented out a debugging plot.

2005-08-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* percent_recovery.m: fixed yet another error in the computation.

2005-08-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* percent_recovery.m: updated documentation and fixed an error in the computation.

2005-07-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time.m: updated documentation. improved fitting by normalizing time.
	* laser_relaxtime.m: added.  takes a laser tracking file and a magnet log file along with other necessary parameters, applies fitting routine, generates plots, and outputs a table describing the relaxation times present.
	* laser_membranestep.m: added.  takes a laser tracking file and a magnet log file along with other necessary parameters, applies fitting routine, generates plots, and outputs a table describing the viscoelastic model parameters found in the data.
	* membrane_step_response.m: added.  returns parameter values for fit to membrane model (Sackmann '98).
	* membrane_step_response_fun.m: added.  file describing the modeling function(s) used for fitting procedure in membrane_step_response.m.

2005-07-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* percent_recovery.m: added.  computes the percent recovery of vector.

2005-06-29  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* evaluateKK.m: fixed bug where variable for tolerance (eta) was inadvertantly placed inside an if-statement.
	* kkr.m: reworked for use with current version of evaluateKK.m.
	* visc_ps: reinserted figure.  added karo line to standard plot as a 'guide for the eye'
	* get_video_viscs.m: reworked to take advantage of current version of load_video_tracking.  Now multiple files are handled by load_video_tracking, each tracker is handled at exactly its own time points (no substituted zeros to fill in matrix), and a mean power spectrum across all beads computed.  Used linear interpolation to put all power spectra on the same grid.
	* get_vrpn_viscs.m: reworked for use with current version of load_vrpn_tracking.

2005-06-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time.m: fixed a bug where, when asked for only one time constant, nothing would happen.
	* relaxtime_fun.m: same.

2005-06-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time.m: added.  This function uses non-linear least squares fitting procedures to compute any number of time constants for creep-relaxation data.  A Kelvin-Voight model was used for equation construction.
	* relaxtime_fun.m: added.  contains the fitting function for relaxation_time.m.

2005-04-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* VE_fluid_model:  removed warning for dividing by zero.  

2005-03-31  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* cone_and_plate:  added this folder for cone_and_plate specific rheology code.

2004-11-04  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* sucrose_viscosity.m:  added the ability to input temperature in Celsius and Kelvin.

2004-10-31  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* driven_bead: added.  contains code for running and analyzing driven bead microrheology experiments.

2004-10-23  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* sucrose_viscosity.m: changed the exceeded solubility condition to a warning instead of an error.


2004-10-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added sucrose_viscosity.m, which models a sucrose solution's viscosity given inputs of concentration in mol/L and temperature in degrees Celsius.  References for this model are given in the code.


2004-09-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added VE_fluid_model.m, which models a simple Viscoelastic fluid model (combined Maxwell and Kelvin-Voight).


2004-05-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* Initial Version
