	* sucrose_viscosity.m: changed the exceeded solubility condition to a warning instead of an error.

	* Added sucrose_viscosity.m, which models a sucrose solution's viscosity given inputs of concentration in mol/L and temperature in degrees Celsius.  References for this model are given in the code.


2004-09-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Added VE_fluid_model.m, which models a simple Viscoelastic fluid model (combined Maxwell and Kelvin-Voight).
